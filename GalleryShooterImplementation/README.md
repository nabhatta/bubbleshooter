Gallery Shooter Implentation Game 2b
Bubble Shooter Game:
In this game you play as a red fish.
You're being attacked by skeleton fish that can lower your health on impacting or by hitting you with their seaweed shooters.
You also have the ability to shoot water streams at the skeletal fish that will destroy them immediately.
The enemies take two zig zag paths towards you, both paths take up a lot of space on screen so it can be a bit difficult to dodge them!
With each hit on an enemy your score increases by 100 points. 
If your health bar completely depletes then you lose the game.
This game has a restart button and keeps track of your high score.

Controls: A to move left, D to move right, SPACE to shoot
